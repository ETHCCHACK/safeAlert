**OUR SOLUTION**

Safe Alert is a decentralized pseudonymous mediation application that enables any user to report a bug and to communicate directly with web 3.0 protocols. Its purpose is to protect the White Hats' interests by providing them with a secure way to alert protocols of detected bugs and providing them with “Proof of Hat” badges to assess publicly their skills and contributions.

We have thus the three following properties:

- The bug information is secured by open source code so the integrity of the company is preserved
- The dApp provide the white hats with public assets (NFTs) to prove with Kleros their contributions in case of dishonest behaviour by the company
- Those public assets are a useful tool for white hack to showcase them and to establish their public and professional reputation

**OUR IMPLEMENTATIONS**

Our platform is built and is using these different technologies :
- Privy, API enabling user data management off-chain 
- IPFS, IPFS is a distributed system for storing and accessing files, websites, applications, and data.
- SISMO, Sismo is a modular Attestations Protocol focused on decentralization, privacy and usability.
- Kleros, a decentralized dispute resolution protocol.
- Polygon, a decentralized Ethereum scaling platform : we deployed our dApp on Polygon.
- Alchemy, a blockchain developer platform providing a suite of developer tools: we used it to deploy our NFT that acts as a public asset to certify the White Hat’s contribution.

Our platform is the product of the successful fusion of these technologies, effectively working together and in perfect harmony.

**PRODUCT ROADMAP**

- Development of new features on hiring platforms and social networks to showcase Sismo reputation badges of White Hats/developers thanks to a plug-in integration on different careers websites of web 3.0 companies. That allows the White Hats to apply with their Metamask account in order to enable the companies to view the different proof of hat certification.

- Challenge between White Hats in relation to a bug bounty (thanks to the encrypted and safe Privy database that contains the lists of all the White Hats addresses)
